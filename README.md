# Event Horizon

## Overview
**Event Horizon** is an **n-body simulation game** where you control a **tiny black hole** competing against other black holes on a dynamic gravitational map. The goal is to consume surrounding masses and other players to grow larger and stronger — a cosmic take on games like *Slither.io* and *Agar.io*.

## Project Vision
A n-body game where you get to control a tiny black hole competing with other black holes on a map where you can eat other masses to gain size and strength. 

Gameplay will include:
- **Player movement** via WASD controls  
- **Mass consumption** to increase size and gravitational strength  
- **n-body simulation mechanics**, meaning all entities exert gravitational force on each other  

If core gameplay is completed early, potential extensions may include:
- **Upgrade systems** (e.g., speed boosts, gravity wells, resistance to collisions)  

The **initial goal** for this project is to develop a working prototype that captures the essential n-body simulation and interactive movement systems.

## Issues & Concerns
- **Implementation complexity:**  
  Building a stable n-body simulation in Rust from scratch poses a significant challenge. Research into existing libraries or frameworks will likely be necessary to establish a foundational physics engine.

- **Time constraints:**  
  Given other ongoing academic commitments, development speed may be limited. The focus will remain on achieving a minimal playable version before exploring advanced features.
