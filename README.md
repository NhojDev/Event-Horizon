# Event Horizon

## Overview
**Event Horizon** is an **n-body simulation game** where you control a **tiny black hole** competing against other black holes on a dynamic gravitational map. The goal is to consume surrounding masses and other players to grow larger and stronger — a cosmic take on games like *Slither.io* and *Agar.io*.


## Project Vision
A n-body game where you get to control a tiny black hole competing with other black holes on a map where you can eat other masses to gain size and strength. 

Gameplay includes:
- **Player movement** via WASD controls  
- **Mass consumption** to increase size and gravitational strength  
- **n-body simulation mechanics**, meaning all entities exert gravitational force on each other  

The **initial goal** for this project is to develop a working prototype that captures the essential n-body simulation and interactive movement systems.

## How to Run



## Lessons Learned
- **WASD Movement:**  
  Movement controls was the hardest to implement/tweak. Using WASD isn't really smooth and I wish I had more knowledge be able to make it more seamless.

- **Time constraints:**  
  Given other ongoing academic commitments, development speed may be limited. The focus will remain on achieving a minimal playable version before exploring advanced features.
